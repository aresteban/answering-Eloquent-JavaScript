# Answering Eloquent JavaScript

## Summary
Coding my solutions to the provided exercise in each chapter of the book [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by [Marijn Haverbeke](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/).

## About
I am currently reading [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and I intend to answer each chapter's exercise as I go without referring to the solutions provided until I finish the book.

I'm have been using JavaScript for some time now, but I haven't read a book about yet. This is my first time reading a technical book about JavaScript.
